# Changelog

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.<CI run number>`. The first two parts come from
`VERSION`; the build number comes from GitHub Actions.

## 0.3 (run 3)

Perks, coins and shop, endless mode, shotguns, and real characters.

- Title menu with Play, Endless (unlocks after clearing level 3), Shop and
  a squad picker. Game-over card shows coins earned and has a Menu button.
- Perk cards after the third and sixth gate of every level: nine perks,
  three offered, stacking to a cap, run-long. Keys 1 to 3 on desktop.
- Coins paid per run; shop with eight permanent upgrades: recruits,
  firepower, gate bonus, armor, boss slayer, coin magnet, scout, shotgun
  squad. Shotguns fire three pellets in a fan.
- Endless mode: no bosses, no squad reset, separate best score.
- Soldiers, zombies, brutes and the boss rebuilt as proper figures with
  legs, arms, helmets, visors, packs, red eyes, plates, spikes, fists and
  a ringed core. Guns recoil, legs run, zombies shamble.
- Save file now holds coins, upgrades, squad type and the endless best.
- Smoke bot takes perks and can run endless; screenshots cover the shop
  and perk cards.
- Balance, bot with no upgrades, taking the first perk offered: squad at
  the boss on levels 1 to 9 was 100, 215, 84, 334, 424, 98, 64, 55, 41;
  reached level 9 at six minutes with 18 soldiers left. Perks make the bot
  far stronger than in 0.2, so bosses on levels 4 and 5 fall fast and the
  wall is the level 6+ waves. Endless: level 7 at three minutes, peak
  squad about 650, still alive. Perk and shop balance is a run 4 item.

## 0.2 (run 2)

Levels, bosses, feel, and sound.

- Runs are now levels: eight gates, a wave after each, then a boss. The
  squad restarts at one soldier every level.
- Boss walks in during a slowed-down arena phase, chews the squad once it
  arrives, and has a swaying core that takes triple damage. Boss health bar
  in the HUD.
- Difficulty rebuilt around level and gate index. Level bonuses added to the
  score. Best level saved and shown on the title card.
- Juice: camera punch, soldier spawn pop, cube bursts for kills, losses,
  gate steps and the boss, count bump, level banners, new-best flash.
- Sound effects synthesised at startup; sound toggle in the pause menu.
- Pause button, auto-pause when the app loses focus or Android back is
  pressed, pause menu with resume, sound and quit.
- Smoke bot plays bosses and reports telemetry per boss; screenshot mode
  covers the boss, level clear, level two and the pause menu.

## 0.1 (run 1)

First playable build.

- Scrolling lane, gate pairs with additive and multiplicative panels.
- Shootable panels: bullet damage climbs the value, multipliers cost more.
- Hidden panels revealed by proximity or a hit.
- Zombie waves placed just ahead of each gate; brutes that scale with the
  squad and take a slice of it.
- Squad formation, auto-fire with a capped tracer rate, drag steering.
- Title, running and game-over screens, floating gate results, local best.
- Difficulty tiers by distance; multipliers fade for big squads; halving
  gates appear later so endless runs plateau.
- Headless unit tests, auto-player smoke test, CI that builds and signs an
  APK and publishes a GitHub Release for Obtainium.
